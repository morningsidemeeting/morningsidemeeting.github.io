Hi, friends. [Freedom Agenda](http://fa.urbanjustice.org/), a member-led project, dedicated to organizing people and communities directly impacted by incarceration to achieve decarceration and system transformation, is organizing a demonstration at City Hall Park on Thursday, August 31. We will remind Mayor Adams that closing the Rikers Island jails by August 31, 2027 is the law and he must take steps now to comply with it. I hope you will join us if you feel led and are able.
