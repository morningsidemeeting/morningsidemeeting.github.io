[The Interfaith Center of New York](https://interfaithcenter.org/) is now [accepting applications](https://interfaithcenter.org/icla-apply/) for the next cohort of the [Interfaith Civic Leadership Academy](https://interfaithcenter.org/icla/). ICLA fellows are diverse clergy members, lay leaders, and faith-based activists working to improve the lives of New Yorkers. In a series of evening workshops, they build relationships across faith lines while learning effective strategies for community leadership, organizing, and advocacy. They then use these skills to create community projects that contribute to the civic life of New York. Each fellow receives $500 in grant funding for their community project, as well as a $500 personal stipend to honor their commitment to the program.

More details are available here: https://interfaithcenter.org/icla/

ICLA “is particularly interested in working with emerging faith leaders – with individuals who have some past experience in community leadership or social activism, but could still benefit from ICLA trainings. The program is not a ‘master class’ for seasoned faith leaders.” Information about previous ICLA fellows can be found here: https://interfaithcenter.org/icla-fellows/

The application shouldn’t take long to complete, so please apply if you’re interested! Or share the information with an emerging faith leader you think could benefit from the program.
