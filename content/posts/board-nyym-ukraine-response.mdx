**Letters sent from NYYM to Friends in Ukraine and in Russia**

To Our Dear Friends in Ukraine:

“The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.” – John 1:5

What a blessing it is that modern communication makes it possible for us to tell you: our hearts are with you, though we are far away. We have been watching and reading as Russian forces have entered your country. One’s home is a deeply precious thing, with all the memories it holds: worship and play, family and friends, hard work and day-to-day joys and sorrows. We are grieved that yours is threatened now.

There is one advantage to the distance between New York and Ukraine: when the sun goes down on your land, it is high in ours. If you should find your sleep disturbed in the night, you can know that Friends in New York Yearly Meeting are holding you in prayer. May God’s comforting arms surround you.

In the Love of the Eternal,<br/>
The Friends of New York Yearly Meeting

To Our Dear Friends in Russia:

The letter shared by Friends House Moscow on February 24th brings to mind the words below.

“All bloody principles and practices, we . . . do utterly deny, with all outward wars and strife and fightings with outward weapons, for any end or under any pretence whatsoever. And this is our testimony to the whole world.” – Declaration from Friends to Charles II, 1660

There is a unique pain when violence is done in one’s name without one’s permission.

We know that your prayers, like ours, are prayers for peace and prayers for protection for every person in Ukraine. In recent days, there has been—rightly—much attention paid to the people of Ukraine, but our hearts are moved to make sure you know that our thoughts are also with you and your children. May you be blessed with courage and discernment, and may you feel the presence and protection of the Divine surround you.

In Friendship,<br/>
The Friends of New York Yearly Meeting

Thanks!

We keep in the light of events in Ukraine and Russia.

We strive and look for opportunities to support people in Ukraine and Russia as much as possible.
Unfortunately, every day we have new laws that restrict the rights and freedoms of people.
