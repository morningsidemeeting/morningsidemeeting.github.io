All members and friends of the New York Yearly Meeting are invited to the Penington Annual Meeting as follows:

Since 1898, the Friends Home Association of New York (FHA) has overseen a Quaker
Residential Community at Penington Friends House, providing lodging, board and
meeting space for Friends in New York City. Please join us in continuing and celebrating this service to our community!

Our mission is to maintain a home and community that can serve as a model for
cooperative living, where Friends and guests can live, gather, and cultivate their inner light, consistent with Quaker practice and testimonies.

The annual membership meeting of the Association will be held in person at Penington Friends House, 215 East 15th Street, New York, NY on Saturday, June 10 at 11:00 am. All are welcome to attend.

If you would like to attend, please RSVP to manager@penington.org and include your name, name of your meeting where you are a member and your email address. We will follow up with some board materials for you to preview in advance of the meeting.

If you have any questions, you can call Robin Drake at 212-673-1730.
