We invite you to join Morningsiders on an excursion to Governors Island. We plan to take the 9:30am Governors Island Ferry for a leisurely exploration, a 11:30am rendezvous at Little Eva’s for lunch (bring your own or pick up something from Little Eva or one of the several food trucks; Little Eva is on Liggett Terrace and is equipped with tables and chairs). After a leisurely lunch, we can amble over to 15 Nolan Park to visit the studio space of the American Indian Community House and their several artists in residence at 1pm. Let’s take time after this visit to have some sharing of our own learnings before heading back to the NYC bustle.

Everyone is welcome!! And it will help us if you can let us know you are coming so we can look for you; please RSVP charleneceis@gmail.com. We hope to see you there, rain or shine!!!

Both Governors Island and the American Indian Community House have more information on their websites and Facebook pages.

In Friendship,<br/>
Ernie Buscemi and Charlene Ray, for the Morningside Monthly Meeting, as we seek to have relationships with our Indigenous neighbors.
