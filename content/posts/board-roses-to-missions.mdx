June Tano shares:

“Roses to Missions” project was started by the Manhattan Project for a Nuclear-Free World and Peace Action New York State to celebrate when Treaty on Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons came into force. In January, 2021, the members of both groups and other NGOs visited many of the 52 countries’ UN missions that had ratified TPNW to show their respect and appreciation. In January 2022, the groups visited some of the 8 newly ratifying countries, and are planning to visit the 9 newly ratifying countries this January.

There will be a march on January 20 at 12:00 pm at the NY Public Library stairs (5th Ave. & 41st St.) and walk to the US Mission to the UN (1st Ave. & 45th St.) to request the US to sign the TPNW. Everyone is welcome. Please contact June or morningsidequakermeeting@gmail.com if you need more information.
