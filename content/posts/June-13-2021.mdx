Morningside Meeting will hold our next **meeting for worship on June 13th at 11 a.m.: a hybrid in-person/remote meeting for worship** followed by a period of
afterwords, announcements, and introductions of visitors and those new to Morningside. A period of fellowship will follow for those wishing to remain, both in person and virtually via breakout rooms. The virtual meeting room will be open at 10:45 a.m. for Friends and attenders to begin to gather. If you are new to Morningside, or not on the email list, and wish to attend, please email:  morningsidequakermeeting@gmail.com.

**A meeting of the Peace and Social Concerns Committee will follow at 12:45 p.m.**, a hybrid in-person and remote meeting.  All are welcome and encouraged to attend, both to learn of the work of the committee, and as well to bring new concerns to the committee for possible action.
 
**For those who wish to participate at Morningside worship in-person**, please note the
following:

- You must reserve a place _in-advance_ via a link that will be sent later this week.
- The meeting room has a capacity of 20 people, so the RSVP system won&#39;t allow more
  than 20 people to register for Meeting.
- Meeting for Worship in-person will occur at Riverside Church on the **12th Floor**, a
  new location for us.
- To enter the Church, you must stop at the security desk to register and complete a
  health waiver. You can find Riverside&#39;s policy and waiver form at this link: https://www.trcnyc.org/waiver/.
- You will also need to confirm your presence with the Greeter when you arrive on the
  12th floor.

Morningside Meeting Ministry and Counsel is a committee charged with the pastoral care of
the meeting. Members are available to answer questions about Quakerism, about Friends
Meeting, and to provide support. To reach the committee, please email:
