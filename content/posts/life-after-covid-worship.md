Most of our lives we live on a conveyer belt. Like a piece of luggage, we go round and round, until someone claims us. Once we are off, we go home, to some place familiar, or we might explore the world around and within us. In essence, we claim ourselves, have a plan, a vision if you will.

What if that experience of living, of discovery, is exacerbated by a dense persistent fog? That is what it has felt like during this covid pandemic for many of us.

Let us gather in worship, share what we have experienced, have learned, gained and lost, and are looking forward to. For more about the Cemetery and a map go to http://www.nycquakers.org/resources/cemetery

Come to the Cemetery on Saturday, June 3rd at 10:30 to share, to eat and to enjoy each otherâ€™s company. Worship sharing starts at 11:00-12:00, followed by a potluck lunch.

And if it is raining, come to 110 Schermerhorn, Brooklyn Friends Meetinghouse.
