We’re thrilled to be opening our Quaker Cemetery in Prospect Park for a Spring Work Day. Join us for a day of restoration, wandering, contemplation, and simply enjoying the beauty of the cemetery.

To ensure everyone’s safety we’re breaking the day into two sessions, with each session limited to 30 people. We also ask that Friends bring their own food, drink and whatever work utensils you can.

Looking forward to seeing everyone on May 15th.

A rain date to come.
