In the fall/winter of 2023-2024, the Sing Sing Prison Museum will continue its virtual webinar programming with a new series called **What I Brought Home and Left Behind: Formerly Incarcerated People Share Memories and Personal Collections**. The next program is at 7 pm on December 14th, featuring Mulumba Kazigo, and will continue on the second Thursday of every month through March 2024. Pre-registration for each session is required; free. 13yrs and up.

Mulumba Kazigo's story is one of resilience, transformation, and hope. A student and accomplished pianist, Kazigo's life took an unexpected turn leading him to spend 15 years in the New York State prison system. Despite the challenges he faced, his journey is a testament to the power of the human spirit to overcome adversity and effect positive change. Today, as a free man, Kazigo is a voice for change, advocating for legal reforms and providing support to those who have endured similar experiences. His daily reflections and advocacy work underscore his commitment to justice and his desire to help others find the same liberation and peace he has achieved.

We all have things we collect and use to decorate our lives and places, things that ground us in our histories or encourage us to aspire to something better, items critical to daily life. Letâ€™s apply this lens with previous residents of Sing Sing, and other correction facilities, and learn how ephemera and objects take on value inside a maximum-security correctional facility. Additionally, the SSPM will share an object from our collection at the start of each conversation drawing collections between the past and now. Participants will listen to a 30-minute presentation and then ask questions.
