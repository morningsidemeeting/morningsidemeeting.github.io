Dear Morningside Friends,

I am very, very fortunate to have been given exhibition space at the Shrine of Saint Frances Cabrini! The artwork will consist of a retrospective on the psalm series that I have been working on, off and on, over the past decade. This exhibition runs from June 1st till June 30th. The shrine is located at 701 Fort Washington Avenue in Manhattan, and is open from Tuesdays through Sundays, 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.

I will give an artist talk on the psalm series on Saturday, June 11th, at 11:00 a.m. The talk will feature reflections on the work on display, including Psalms number 1, 19, 22, 23, 27, 40, 42, 90, 93, 150.

The best way to access the shrine is to take the 'A' train to the 190 street station, or by the M4 bus.

The exhibition is sponsored as an event by the Northern Manhattan Artist Alliance (NoMAA) as part of its annual Uptown Art Stroll.

The following links provide more information about the shrine, NoMAA and my website. Thank you for your support! I hope to see you. If you cannot make the talk, I would be most happy to give you a 'private tour' of the show, just let me know. üòá
