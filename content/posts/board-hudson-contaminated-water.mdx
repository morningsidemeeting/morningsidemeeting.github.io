I just wanted to let you know that Manhattan Project for a Nuclear-Free World is planning to hold a rally on Saturday, April 8, from 1PM in front of the New York Public Library to oppose Japanâ€™s announcement to start dumping 1.3 million tons of radioactive wastewater into the Pacific Ocean from the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.

Recently Holtec, the owner of Indian Point nuclear power plant, announced about dumping 1 million gallons (about 4,000 tons) of highly radioactive spent fuel pool water into the Hudson River in August or September.

Those acts will become the bad examples, and many companies in the US and in the world could follow them.

We welcome you to join us the rally. Some groups in Westchester are interested in joining the rally to distribute flyers etc.

We will send you more details once an official announcement is ready. Meanwhile, please save the date. Please feel free to reach out to me should you have any questions.
