> Kia Heath is a Morningsider from a long time ago whom I see often at Pendle Hill worship. She asked if I might find someone to give her a hand since she is in the process of moving from an elevator building on 106th Street and Broadway to a two-flight walk up nearby. She needs help carrying a 6' aluminum ladder back and forth and help painting or spotting her as she paints the walls.

> If you can help any day from Wednesday April 21st through Sunday April 25th please contact morningsidequakermeeting@gmail.com for Kia's contact information.
