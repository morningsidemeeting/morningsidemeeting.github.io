Robert adds:

> If you are able to attend any time and let me know, we could perhaps arrange to meet at Taszo, a neighborhood hangout near the museum and my apartment to share our responses to the exhibit. The gallery is a meditative space and the exhibit inspired much to reflect on. My email is roberto_renwick@yahoo.com
