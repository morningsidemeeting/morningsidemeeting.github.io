Concern for Quaker Living (CQL), a sub committee of the NYQM’s Ministry & Counsel invites you to a worship sharing gathering at the Cemetery.

How can we find abundance, confidence and trust?

We live in fragmented times, the earth is suffering, people are restless, hope is fleeting and tolerance and love are in short supply. Instead of embracing each other’s humanity and life itself, we argue, separate, form groups of “us” and “them”, and basically forfeit our voices and interest in listening to others.

But what about you?

Have you lost your voice, your ability to trust?

Are you finding an inward path to support you?

Isn’t it time to seek community, to share with an abundance of spirit, and to embrace the world around us?

Come to the Cemetery on Saturday, September 30th at 10:30 to share, to eat and to enjoy each other’s company.

Worship sharing starts at 11:00-12:00, followed by a potluck lunch.

If it is raining, come to 110 Schermerhorn, Brooklyn Friends Meetinghouse.
