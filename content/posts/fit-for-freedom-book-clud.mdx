Friends are cordially invited to this reading group beginning on Monday, November 22, 2021, 8:00 - 10:00 P.M. EST. We will read the book “Fit For Freedom, Not For Friendship - Quakers, African Americans and the Myth of Racial Justice” by Donna McDaniel and Vanessa Julye, and we will gather on the third Monday of every month.

Vanessa Julye will be joining us on November 22nd, for the start of the reading of the book. If you have any questions for Vanessa, please forward them ahead of November 19th to the e-mail: fitforfreedomnotforfriendship@gmail.com, and mark your subject line: “Questions for Vanessa.” We may not get to answer all of the questions, due to time limitations.

Chapters in the book are roughly 30 to 40 pages long. We estimate a chapter per session is probably a reasonable expectation; HOWEVER, to allow full discussion and deeper understanding of the full work, we will take the time that it takes. If a chapter requires a deeper and longer dive, we plan to take that time. We suggest that Friends read the preface, Authors’ statement, and the first chapter prior to our first gathering.

We are suggesting that both, [the book](https://quakerbooks.org/collections/antiracism/products/fit-for-freedom-not-for-friendship-4003) and its [study guide](https://quakerbooks.org/products/fit-for-freedom-study-guide-2269) can be ordered from FGC. The book cost is currently $22.95 plus shipping, while the study guide is a downloadable e-book that costs $5. Support for obtaining the book and study guide is available. Please send your request to the e-mail mentioned above, and mark your subject line: “Book and/or Study Guide.” Make sure your e-mail includes your full name, your shipping address and contact number.
