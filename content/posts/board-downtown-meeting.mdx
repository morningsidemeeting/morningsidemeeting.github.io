Come and join us as we meet to worship outdoors every Thursday evening from the beginning of May to the end of September, from 6:00 to 7:00 PM, near the Labyrinth of Contemplation in the northwest corner of Battery Park.

You can look for the colorful flower flags over the benches.

We will be wearing masks and socially distancing but as the sign we put up on the gate says, ‘ALL ARE WELCOME’.
