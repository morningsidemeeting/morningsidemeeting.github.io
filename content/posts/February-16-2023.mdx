**Meeting for Worship**

Morningside Meeting will hold our next **meeting for worship on February 26 at 11 a.m.: a hybrid in-person/remote meeting for worship,** followed by afterwords, announcements, and introductions of visitors and those new to Morningside. The virtual meeting room will be open at 10:45 a.m. for Friends and attenders to begin to gather. If you are new to Morningside, or not on the email list, and wish to attend, please email: morningsidequakermeeting@gmail.com.

Meeting With Children is back every First Day (Sunday)! If you have questions about bringing your child with you to worship, please email morningsidequakermeeting@gmail.

You are invited to join Morningsiders for **breakfast** this Sunday in the Riverside Cafe, Riverside Church, at 9:30 am. Just select your breakfast and tell the cashier you are with the Quakers and the meeting picks up the tab. It's a lovely time to get to know one another, to ask questions and to get ready for the day. Please join us!

**The Racial Justice Study Group** invites you to hear a guest speaker at 12:45 pm. Peter Murchison has been active in gun violence prevention since the shootings at Sandy Hook, where his nephew Daniel Barden was killed. He is the clerk of the Wilton (CT) Quaker Meeting, which supports his work as a ministry. Peter also serves as the Gun Violence Prevention Coordinator for NYYM through the WCC. He is currently serving a 3-month assignment with Friends Committee on National Legislation in DC to help define their gun violence policy and to be an advocate on their behalf. All are welcome.

**For those who wish to participate at Morningside worship in person**, please note the following:

- In-person Meeting for Worship will occur at Riverside Church **on the 12th Floor.**
- You must reserve a place _in-advance_ via a link that will be sent later this week.
