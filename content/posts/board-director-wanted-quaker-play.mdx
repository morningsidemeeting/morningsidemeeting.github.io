Stage Director wanted!

A Quaker organization in NYC, 15th Street Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends, will be producing three performances of a play in October. It has 16 characters to be played, probably, by nine actors. Set in Philadelphia in 1776, it’s about a Quaker representative at The Constitutional Convention. It’s expected to run about one hour 20 minutes. It will be presented in their lovely 19th-century meetinghouse in Manhattan. Rehearsals will be in Manhattan. Director and actors will be non-union.

If you’re interested, please email Steve with your CV and your questions. Please do not contact the Quakers via any other avenue.
