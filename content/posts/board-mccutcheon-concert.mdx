Sally Campbell invites our community to attend “Calling All The Children Home: Songs of the Spirit, Faith, and Inclusion”, a livestreamed concert by John McCutcheon, on Saturday, May 1st, 2021 at 7:30pm EDT.

John McCutcheon, the renowned folksinger and one-time seminarian, has never shied away from spiritual and religious imagery in his music. One critic described him as “someone who can talk about God without creeping you out.” His songs of dignity, courage, and compassion are rooted in a generations-deep faith. He’ll tell stories and sing about what he thinks is his most subtle and important work.

[Sponsored and co-produced](https://www.nycquakers.org/event/john-mccutcheon-calling-all-the-children-home-virtual/) by NYQM Ministry and Counsel Committee.

Tickets range from $5 to $50, and [can be purchased online](https://boxoffice.mandolin.com/collections/john-mccutcheon/products/john-mccutcheon-calling-all-the-children-home-songs-of-the-spirit-faith-and-inclusion-4-1?utm_source=ef&utm_medium=aff&utm_campaign=79&oid=79&affid=434).
