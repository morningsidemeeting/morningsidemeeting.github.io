Hi Friends,

I have recently completed a major piece of artwork, a series of paintings on the theme of Psalm 90. The artwork has been viewed by Rick Hamlin, executive director of Guideposts magazine, who enjoyed the work and has written a review of it. You can read his review, and view the video at this link:

The revised video appears underneath his lovely review.

if you would like to read in depth about the piece you can go to my blog page at www.bernardcwinterart.com

I will be looking for a gallery space to exhibit the work and I would love to have this series printed as a book. I welcome feedback on the series, I would like to include quotes on my website, with your permission. In the meantime, the artwork lives on display in my living room. :)

Thank you again for your support. May you find joy and purpose in your days.
