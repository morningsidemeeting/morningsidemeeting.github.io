Announcing the return of the MMM Cookie Swap on December 18, after meeting in-person! We have some great bakers in the meeting and this is a lovely chance for all of to share these gifts. The idea is that everyone who wants to brings 3 dozen cookies. Bring your favorite cookie whether made or purchased. Or just come! There will be goodie bags so everyone can go home with an assortment of cookies. We hope to see you there.
