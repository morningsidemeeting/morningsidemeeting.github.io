Miguel Herrera shares this information with Morningsiders:

On Friday August 11th, the birthday of Hip Hop, the Universal Hip Hop Museum is hosting Hip Hop's 50th Birthday Jam. They will celebrate Hip Hop’s elements at Mill Pond Park (Exterior Street and 150th Street), next to the museum’s construction site in the Bronx. The event is free.

The party starts at noon EST with music, food, and drinks (of course), murals created by artists courtesy of Thrive Collective, including Tats Cru, Lady Pink, and Queen Andrea. Immediately following the visual art, RAPAMANIA, a rap showcase hosted by the iconic Van Silk, begins at 2pm EST. Next up, Red Bull BC One will host an Open Cypher, presenting a number of world-renowned breakers and local talent.
