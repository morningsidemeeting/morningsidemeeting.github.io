**Meeting for Worship**
Morningside Meeting will hold our next **meeting for worship on October 30 at 11 a.m.: a hybrid in-person/remote meeting for worship,** followed by afterwords, announcements, and introductions of visitors and those new to Morningside. The virtual meeting room will be open at 10:45 a.m. for Friends and attenders to begin to gather. If you are new to Morningside, or not on the email list, and wish to attend, please email: morningsidequakermeeting@gmail.com.

**For those who wish to participate at Morningside worship in person**, please note the following:

- In-person Meeting for Worship will occur at Riverside Church **on the 12th Floor.**
- You must reserve a place _in-advance_ via a link that will be sent later this week.
- At this time, masks are required for in-person worship.

**At 12:45, following Sunday worship, Charlene Ray and Jerry Reisig will facilitate a worship on sharing life stories.** During the pandemic, several new people have come to Meeting, but we have had neither the time nor the means to get to know each other better. Without potluck and those moments of face-to-face interaction, we question how we can share ourselves with others. If we cannot share physically, perhaps we can connect by sharing important stories in our lives. Some of the stories that we have incorporated in our spiritual growth involve narratives about times of welcome and times of rejection. Both stories have helped us form our spiritual identities. The first story, welcome, may be easier to share, although the second story, rejection, is equally essential to our development. Friends will be queried about both stories and the wisdom they may have given. As in all worship sharing, Friends are invited to share or not to share as they are led.

Morningside Meeting Ministry and Counsel is a committee charged with the pastoral care of
the meeting. Members are available to answer questions about Quakerism, about Friends
Meeting, and to provide support. To reach the committee, please email:

We hope Friends will [consider making a contribution for our annual appeal](https://morningsidemeeting.org/posts/finance-2022-appeal/).
