On Sunday, February 18th, 2024 from 12:45 to 3:30 pm, come learn about Black & Pink NYC’s pen-pal matching program! [Black & Pink](https://www.blackandpink.org/) is an organization our meeting supports that does prison and jail support for queer and HIV+ people. One of their main programs is their pen-pal matching program to connect incarcerated members with people on the outside who are interested in ongoing correspondence. Two organizers will come talk to us about the pen-pal program and other volunteer opportunities with Black & Pink. Then there will be time to either match with a pen-pal and write an introductory letter to them, or those who don’t want a pen-pal right away can write birthday cards to incarcerated members. Please join us and learn more about Black & Pink!
