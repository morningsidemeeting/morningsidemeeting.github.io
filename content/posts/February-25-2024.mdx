**Meeting for Worship**

Morningside Meeting will hold our next **[meeting for worship](worship) on February 25 at 11 a.m.: a hybrid in-person/remote meeting for worship,** followed by afterwords, announcements, and introductions of visitors and those new to Morningside. The virtual meeting room will be open at 10:45 a.m. for Friends and attenders to begin to gather. If you are new to Morningside, or not on the email list, and wish to attend, please email: morningsidequakermeeting@gmail.com.

Join Morningsiders for breakfast this Sunday in the Riverside Cafe, Riverside Church, at 9:30 am. Just select your breakfast and tell the cashier you are with the Quakers and the meeting picks up the tab. Itâ€™s a lovely time to get to know one another, to ask questions and to get ready for the day.

We welcome children to come to Meeting with Children on the 13th floor on Sundays from 11:00 until shortly before noon. If you have any questions, please email morningsidequakermeeting@gmail.com.

At 12:45 pm join the Racial Justice Study Group for the continuing discussion of _Braiding Sweetgrass_ by Robin Wall Kimmerer.

**For those who wish to participate at Morningside worship in person**, please note the following:

- In-person Meeting for Worship will occur at Riverside Church **on the 12th Floor.**

Morningside Meeting Ministry and Counsel is a committee charged with the pastoral care of the meeting. Members are available to answer questions about Quakerism, about Friends Meeting, and to provide support. To reach the committee, please email: morningsidequakermeeting@gmail.com.
