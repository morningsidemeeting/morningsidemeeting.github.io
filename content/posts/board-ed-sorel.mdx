Here is a profile of one of our more famous Morningsiders: Ed Sorel.

Gary Sandman wrote a book, _Quaker Artists_, which we have in our library. Every month he writes about another Quaker artist and this time it was about Ed who joined our meeting a long time ago, but we still claim him as ours. On the shelf in the library called By Morningsiders there are books and CD's by many past and present members including Ed.

Gary's book and artists pieces he wrote subsequent to the book are available through his website: http://garysandmanartist.com.
