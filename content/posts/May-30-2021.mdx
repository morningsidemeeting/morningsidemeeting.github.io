Morningside Meeting will hold our next **meeting for worship on May 30th at 11 a.m.: a hybrid in-person/remote meeting for worship** followed by a period of
afterwords, announcements, and introductions of visitors and those new to Morningside. A  brief period of fellowship will follow, in person and via breakout rooms for those who wish to attend.  The virtual meeting room will be open at 10:45 a.m. for Friends and attenders to begin to gather. If you are new to Morningside, or not on the email list, and wish to attend, please email:  morningsidequakermeeting@gmail.com.

**At 12:45 p.m., a session on the meaning and practice of Quaker ministry will follow, offered by Ministry and Counsel.** The session may be of particular interest to those new to Morningside Meeting and/or to Quakerism, as we consider what we mean when we say that all of us are ministers. All are welcome, and encouraged to attend.  

**For those who wish to participate at Morningside worship in-person**, please note the
following:

- You must reserve a place _in-advance_ via a link that will be sent later this week.
- The meeting room has a capacity of 20 people, so the RSVP system won&#39;t allow more
  than 20 people to register for Meeting.
- Meeting for Worship in-person will occur at Riverside Church on the **20th Floor**, a
  new location for us.
- To enter the Church, you must stop at the security desk to register and complete a
  health waiver. You can find Riverside&#39;s policy and waiver form at this link: https://www.trcnyc.org/waiver/.
- You will also need to confirm your presence with the Greeter when you arrive on the
  20th floor.

Morningside Meeting Ministry and Counsel is a committee charged with the pastoral care of
the meeting. Members are available to answer questions about Quakerism, about Friends
Meeting, and to provide support. To reach the committee, please email:
