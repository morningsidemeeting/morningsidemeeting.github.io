Dear Friends,

I am happy to inform you that immediately after the Charlotte Ehrman bequest was approved to hep new immigrant at the Manhattan School for Children on the Upper West Side, those funds have been put to work!

A workshop entitled “Know Your Rights!” is planned for this coming Thursday, March 14th at 5:30pm to help the new immigrant families understand their legal rights at this crucial time in their lives. Legal counseling will be provided by the Cabrini Immigration Services located in Washington Heights. At this event, a dinner will be served to the families using catering from the Migrant Kitchen.

The Open Arms Committee at MSC is inviting members of the Morningside Meeting to come to this event, see what work is being done, and meet the immigrant families. Volunteer opportunities begin with set up at 4:00 pm and will continue with supporting registration for summer school. Trader Joe gift cards will also be handed out to the families, and that is a direct result of the Charlotte Ehrman bequest. We will need to clean up the event ends at 7:30pm.

If you are interested in attending, or volunteering, please contact the director of the Open Arms Committee, Diana Bartlett, at diana.bartlett@outlook.com

The address of the school is 154 West 93rd Street between Columbus and Amsterdam Avenue.
