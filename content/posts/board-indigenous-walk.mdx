You are invited to join some Morningside Friends to celebrate Indigenous Peoples Day, October 10. We plan to meet 10:15am at the National Museum of the American Indian for a wander through their Native New York exhibit to be followed by a time of sharing,

We will start with where we are, enlarge our understanding of what was here before the European settlements and ask where the remnants of these cultures are now? What part of creation represented in this visit took your breath away? What does it mean to act justly, love mercy and walk humbly?

Please RSVP to charleneceis@gmail.com with your name, so we know to expect you.
