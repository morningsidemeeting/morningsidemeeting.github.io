Morningside Meeting‘s Peace and Social Concerns invites you to a conversation about seeking right relationships with Indigenous People of New York City. Ernie Buscemi and Charlene Ray will be facilitating.

We offer a free, one-hour virtual call on Tuesday, April 19, 2022, at 6:30 pm, as a place to begin. We plan to show a 15-minute video, The Story of Manhatta, and spend some time Worship Sharing around its message: ‘Erase the Erasure’.

Please join us for this provocative discussion by emailing Charlene at charleneceis@gmail.com. A zoom link will be emailed to participants a day or two before the workshop. We hope to see you then!
