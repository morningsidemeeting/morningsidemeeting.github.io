From 11/27 to 12/1, there were many events inside and outside of the UN. Many young people attended too.

On 11/28, in front of the UN, a rally was held to thank countries that have ratified the treaty, and to urge nuclear weapon states to give them up.
Hibakusha from Japan, Korea, and New Mexico spoke out for “No More Nuclear War”. Also a youth from Japan spoke too.

Then the march started walking to the Permanent Mission of the United States to the United Nations and to the Permanent Mission of Russia to the Nations. At the final destination, the representative of the Russian Mission read a very nice letter.

On 11/30, there was a rally in front of the Consulate General of Japan in New York. Attendees spoke out to urge Japan to ratify the TPNW, and stop dumping the radioactive waste water into the Pacific Ocean.
