Bernard Winter shares:

My wife Sandra has felt called to organize an on-line concert, titled "Voices for Peace", in which she and twenty other artists from Israel, India, the United States and Europe will share songs, chants, and prayers from different traditions all expressing messages of hope, love and peace.

The concert will take place Saturday, December 30th at 1:00pm Eastern Time/ 12:00 Noon Central Time/ 10:00am Pacific Time.

There is a suggested donation of $10 - $25, but you can give as much or as little as you wish. All proceeds are going to Doctors Without Borders, which is working in 72 countries around the world, including assisting people affected by the conflicts in Ukraine, Gaza, Israel, and Syria.

We would be honored to have you join us and spread the word among other like-minded friends.

Wishing you all the joy and peace of this season of light,
Bernard and Sandra Winter
