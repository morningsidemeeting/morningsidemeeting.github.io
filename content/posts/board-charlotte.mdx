Charlotte Erhman, a cherished Morningsider, is recovering from a fall at Village/Care on West Houston Street. In a recent visit from Ernie, Charlotte was talkative, and smiling when her roommate kept getting into the conversation. She still is confined to the bed and said several times about going to her own home. She is not comfortable with the phone, but visits and cards are welcome.
