The next Racial Justice Study Group will be held Sunday March 28, 1pm. The same Zoom link used for meeting for worship sent out by Ministry & Counsel will be used. We hope you can join us for a discussion on "Othering" Blackness.

Prior to the RJSG meeting please view this 14 minute interview with noted author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie on a Bill Moyers program.

We will also discuss the first 11 pages of Chapter 12 of Isabel Wilkerson's book, _Caste_.

Feel free to take notes on the taped interview and the reading for our discussion.
