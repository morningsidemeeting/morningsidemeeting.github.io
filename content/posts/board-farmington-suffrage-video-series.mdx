Three videos from the [1816 Farmington Quaker Meetinghouse](https://www.farmingtonmeetinghouse.org/)'s program series "Struggle for Women's Suffrage: Politics and Race" are now available for viewing on YouTube. The most recent “[Frances Ellen Watkins Harper: Poet, Activist, Reformer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft6d3wTVbqc),” is presented by Marcia Robinson, Asst. Professor of Religion, Syracuse University. Harper was an influential abolitionist, suffragist, poet, lecturer, and reformer who co-founded the National Association of Colored Women’s Clubs. She was a household name in the nineteenth century. Born free in Baltimore, she was one of the first African American women to be published in the United States.
