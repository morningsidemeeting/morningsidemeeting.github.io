Dear Friends,

We are reading about the growing number of financial scams and are concerned that members of our community may be vulnerable.

Cybercriminals are targeting bank customers directly through known and trusted channels of communication, such as telephone, text message and email. They may “spoof” your bank’s telephone number, so that your bank’s name appears on your caller ID. Cybercriminals use this tactic to gain your trust.

Increased awareness of financial scams can help you protect yourself. If you receive an unexpected telephone call, text message or e-mail that appears to be from your bank, take the following precautions:

NEVER provide personal or financial information (i.e., social security numbers, card numbers, expiration dates, online banking usernames or passwords, one-time-passcodes) in response to telephone calls, e-mails or text messages.

NEVER trust your telephone caller ID. Cybercriminals can easily spoof a telephone number to make it appear as though the call is coming from any number. Before you provide any personal information to a caller, hang up and call the bank or credit card company back using a number you trust, such as the telephone number on the back of your bank or credit card.

NEVER click links provided in emails or text messages. Doing so could take you to a fake website that appears to be legitimate. It may solicit personal information or install malicious viruses on your device. Always go to the company’s website through a trusted source, such as typing in the company’s website directly or locating it through a trusted search engine.

NEVER provide a passcode that is sent to your phone to someone who calls you. Criminals attempt to trick individuals into revealing passcodes by saying that they need to “verify your identity.” The criminals could use your identity or information to open accounts or access accounts associated with you. They need the passcode to complete a transaction or to access your accounts.

NEVER provide any personal information to someone who calls you, regardless of the “story” or reason they provide. Hang up and call the company back through a telephone number that you trust.

Be careful, Friends,<br/>
Your Communications Committee
