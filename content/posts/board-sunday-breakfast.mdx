We invite you to join us for breakfast at the Riverside Cafe at Riverside Church on Sunday, August 28, at 9:30am, in person. We love this chance to be with each other, catch up and share what'sgoing on at Morningside and in Quakerism so we hope you will join us. Anyone at Riverside can direct you to the cafe, go through the line, select your food and tell the cashier you are with the Quakers and come join us at one of the round tables; the Meeting will pick up the tab. We hope to see you there!
