It seems that the world is spinning faster, that it is difficult to make sense out of it, with vestiges of the latest pandemic, war in the Ukraine, ramping inflation and the impact of climate on our lives. How can anyone concentrate on the future when the present is so turbulent?

You are invited to join some NYQM Friends for an evening with Anthea Perkinson (see her bio below), who has a passion for financial planning and looking into that crystal ball called the future. Financial options get complicated quickly; this is a great opportunity to ask questions, to chat with each other, and enjoy some refreshments.

The financial workshop is organized by the NYQM working group, Concern for Quaker Living (CQL), and will be given on, Thursday, October 20, 6:30-8, Room 1, at 15 Rutherford Place. Please join us in person or on zoom.

As space is limited to 20 people, if you plan to attend in person, please RSVP by email to charleneceis@gmail.com by Monday Oct 17, along with any questions or concerns. This will help us plan!

And if you plan to attend virtually, please RSVP to charleneceis@gmail.com to get the zoom link, several days ahead.

We hope to see you there!!!
