Stories! Let’s tell our stories! Weaving your story with ours.

Join us for a Quarterwide workshop to write and tell our stories and then to consider how they weave together.

We are fortunate to have Jane Wohl, a birthright Quaker and remarkable teacher of children and adults. In 2016 she retired from a 45-year teaching career, most recently teaching the Goddard College MFA in Writing. She’s a mom, a grandmom and newly enrolled in the MDiv program at Union Theological Seminary. She’s lively, she’s adventuresome, she loves words and stories. It will be fun.

SAVE THE DATE: Saturday, February 19, 11-2, by zoom, unless hybrid is an option. Come with writing supplies, notebook, laptop, whatever it is that you use to write. Space is limited to 20 so sign up soon by emailing Charlene Ray at charleneceis@gmail.com.

To see Jane "live", visit one of her poetry workshops on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/IHj-KRLBNFk).
