Morningside Meeting will hold our next **meeting for worship on July 4th at 11 a.m.:  a hybrid in-person/remote meeting for worship, followed by a called Meeting for Worship with a Concern for Business at the rise of meeting.** A period of afterwords, announcements, and introductions of visitors and those new to Morningside will then follow. The virtual meeting room will be open at 10:45 a.m. for Friends and attenders to begin to gather. If you are new to Morningside, or not on the email list, and wish to attend, please email: morningsidequakermeeting@gmail.com.

**A called meeting for worship with a concern for business will follow at the rise of meeting, at 12:00 noon, to consider a minute brought by the Peace and Social Concerns Committee on the planned release of radioactive water from Fukashima into the Pacific Ocean.** All are welcome to attend.    


**For those who wish to participate at Morningside worship in-person**, please note the
following:

- You must reserve a place _in-advance_ via a link that will be sent later this week.
- The meeting room has a capacity of 20 people, so the RSVP system won&#39;t allow more
  than 20 people to register for Meeting.
- Meeting for Worship in-person will occur at Riverside Church on the **12th Floor**.
- To enter the Church, you must stop at the security desk to register and complete a
  health waiver. You can find Riverside&#39;s policy and waiver form at this link: https://www.trcnyc.org/waiver/.
- You will also need to confirm your presence with the Greeter when you arrive on the
  12th floor.

Morningside Meeting Ministry and Counsel is a committee charged with the pastoral care of
the meeting. Members are available to answer questions about Quakerism, about Friends
Meeting, and to provide support. To reach the committee, please email:
