As a member of Morningside, I am writing to ask you to help me raise $1,680 before June 30 to help Akira Rose stay in NYC, close to her work directing AFSC’s Liberation Summer Camp at 15 Rutherford Place.

Liberation Summer Camp and its longer more in-depth, Liberation Academy, create alternatives to violence for young people at risk of being incarcerated. Last year, along with several Mornningsiders, I got to see firsthand how powerful this program is. Their final projects were inspirational and lifechanging. Now I have received a request to repeat the support Morningsiders provided last year to help Akira Rose, its program director. Here is what she is asking:

> My name is Akira Rose and I am currently the Youth Activism Fellow for AFSC’s Healing Justice NY program. This summer, we are celebrating the 10th anniversary of Liberation Summer Camp (!), a 5-week advocacy camp for youth ages 15-20. For the past ten years, we have taught young people how to create change in their communities through art and activism. During last year’s camp, I was able to stay at Penington Friends House, which is right next door to where we host the summer camp. As someone who lives on Long Island, being in such close proximity to where the summer camp took place made being in community with campers and staff alike a smooth process. I was able to show up early and create a welcoming environment before campers arrived and stick around to invite questions and offer support to campers and our staff. Overall, staying at Penington allowed me to show up and support the camp to my fullest capacity. This year, I anticipate the needs of the camp only increasing and I know that residing at the Penington for its duration will ensure that we can all focus our energy on having another successful year as we hit this amazing milestone. Thank you for supporting both me and Liberation Summer Camp as we create healing justice in our community.

The cost for her stay at Penington Friends House is $1,680 for July 8-August 12, for a furnished sublet room and 5 dinners/week. In response to the heartfelt program and its wisdom, the state of violence especially racially motivated violence, I invite Morningside members and attenders to offer some financial support to enable Akira to participate safely and more fully in Liberation Sumer Camp.

Please make checks payable to Morningside Monthly Meeting with Akira in the memo line. Send them to me, Charlene Ray 44 West 62nd Street, #27D, New York NY 10023. I will batch them, have them deposited and ask for a check for a like amount from Morningside payable to Penington Friends House for the purpose of rent for Akira. This is my leading and one that was born here in our Morningside worship experience, it is not an official Morningside event. I simply ask that you join me in seeing this as an opportunity to support life giving, life affirming racial justice action. I will gladly accept any size donation. Thank you.

Also, this could not be done without the support and cooperation of the Morningside Meeting and Penington Friends House.

In grateful and appreciative Friendship,<br/>Charlene
