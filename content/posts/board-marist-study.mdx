Marist College is recruiting participants for a research study on religious experiences, LGBTQ+ identity, allyship, activism, and health. This study has been approved by the Marist College Institutional Review Board (IRB).

 
"We are looking for people who currently practice or have previously practiced a religion AND identify as LGBTQ+ or as an ally to the LGBTQ+ community. We define LGBTQ+ ally as any person (including those who are members of the LGBTQ+ community) who actively supports or advocates for those who are LGBTQ+. The study is completely online and anonymous and should take 20-30 minutes to complete. You will be asked to respond to a number of questions related to current and previous religious beliefs and experiences, allyship and activism, identity, and mental and physical health.
