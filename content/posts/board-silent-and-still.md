What is Silent and Still? It is a dance/music opportunity—but how can it be silent and still if it is music and movement? Come and find out! Brooklyn Meetinghouse, March 19!

Being brought to us by the work of Concern for Quaker Living (“CLQ”) of NYQM, we hope that this movement and music will bring us into the spring and new/renewed relationships with spirit, each other and our world. Bring snacks to share at intermission.

Use this link to find out more about the program and the performers and to sign up: https://www.groupmuse.com/events/13117-silent-and-still. With the code, quaker, you can bypass the Groupmuse $5 fee. While the program is offered free, we will be asking for donations that go directly to the performers ($20 per person is suggested).

Silent and Still, May 19, 2:30pm, 110 Schermerhorn St, Brooklyn. Hope to see you there! https://www.groupmuse.com/events/13117-silent-and-still.
