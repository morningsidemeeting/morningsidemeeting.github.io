Dear All NYC Friends & attenders,

The NYQM Concern for Quaker Living working group, the Cemetery Committee and ARCH invite you to join us in the Cemetery on June 4 for a time to remember Friends and family we have lost and the pandemic challenges that disrupted our communities.

This time is planned as a memorial service, worship as led to speak our grief and name departed loved ones. The Cemetery will be opening at 10:30am to offer time to have a walk around it and settle in for an 11am beginning time. The worship will go as long as it is settled.

The Cemetery will be open until 2:30pm. You are invited to bring water and pack a lunch for after worship and spend some quiet time in this peaceful place. For more about the Cemetery and a map go to http://www.nycquakers.org/resources/cemetery

In case of rain, we will be using the Brooklyn Meetinghouse. Please register by sending a request to charleneceis@gmail.com with Meeting for Grief in the subject line. This way we can be sure to let you know if we are not meeting in the Cemetery.
