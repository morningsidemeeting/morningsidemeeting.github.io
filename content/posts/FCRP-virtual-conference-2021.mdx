THE FRIENDS CONFERENCE ON RELIGION AND PSCYHOLOGY

The Friends Conference on Religion and Psychology is one of the oldest conferences in the U.S. dedicated to individual spiritual exploration with a focus on in-depth psychology, specifically Jungian psychology. 

The conference began in the dark shadow of war in 1943. A group of Quakers, many trained as Jungian analysts and psychologists, came to see how coming to know oneâ€™s inner landscape through dreams, creative work, and active imagination actually supported the life of the spirit. The inward journey through the dark and light of the unconscious, they discovered, helped the Inner Light shine more brightly.

Today, a darkness similar to the time when our founders created the community of FCRP has settled on the world, making the work we do and share more relevant and more important than ever.

FCRP has taken place annually in the spring for 78 years and is held on Memorial Day weekend.  Because of the pandemic, we will hold our May conference virtually again. The dates are May 28-30, 2021. We are hoping to return next year to our traditional in-person conference at the Quaker retreat center, Pendle Hill near Swarthmore, Pennsylvania.
