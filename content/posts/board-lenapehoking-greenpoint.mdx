Lenapehoking\* is the first Lenape-curated exhibition of Lenape cultural arts, both historic and contemporary, in the City of New York. The exhibition features masterworks by Lenape artists past and present (beadwork, a turkey feather cape, and a culinary tapestry from the seed rematriation project in the Hudson Valley) as examples of the survivance and beauty of Lenape culture, and more. This long overdue experience will facilitate deeper understandings of Lenape culture.

Join curator Joe Baker, enrolled member of the Delaware Tribe of Indians and co-founder and executive director of the Lenape Center, for the virtual opening on Thursday, January 20 at 7 pm, as he discusses the exhibition works from Greenpoint Library.

_\* Lenapehoking is the Lenape name for Lenape land, which spans from Western Connecticut to Eastern Pennsylvania, and the Hudson Valley to Delaware, with Manhattan at its center. Due to centuries of colonialism perpetuated by genocide, forced displacement, and systemic oppression, today the Lenape Diaspora is dispersed throughout the U.S. and Canada._
