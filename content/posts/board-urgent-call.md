Some members and attenders of Morningside Monthly Meeting have been informally discussing the subject "Urgent Call". Its text is available from the sponsors only as a [downloadable PDF file](https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/53cdbcd4-0cda-4cfe-b4c7-3a9a2892e5b9/UrgentCall_toRSoF-FINAL.pdf). As such, it is not smartphone friendly.

Our Communications Committee has made an [HTML version](/communications/urgentcall) available on the website so that our members and attenders can more easily view the "Urgent Call" on their phones.
