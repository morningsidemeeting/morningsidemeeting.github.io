Charlene Ray shares the following announcement:

We’re all aging, it’s what we do! And sometimes that is wonderful, and sometimes it is scary, but we need not do it alone. 

The ARCH Foundations Workshop (formerly the ARCH Visitor Training) is an introduction to the ARCH network: over 150 Friends in NYYM who form a community of practice. It is open to anyone in NYYM who would like to connect with a network of resources and support for a ministry of caring for each other and ourselves as we grow older or are differently-abled. 

Our four weeks together (Saturdays 11 a.m.-1 p.m. April 17, April 24, May 1, May 8) will be engaging, reflective, nourishing, informative, and fun. Please sign up today to participate by going to the New York Yearly Meeting website (www.nyym.org)m click on ARCH on the right column, go to Joining the ARCH Network and click on the ‘sign up today’ link in the last sentence.  Or email arch@nyym.org.
