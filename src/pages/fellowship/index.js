      <h2>Quaker Fellowship</h2>
      <p>
        There are an estimated 300,000 Quakers worldwide with a diverse range of
        theologies and beliefs, but only one Spirit that moves through all.
        Today, Friends celebrate the diversity of worship among Friends, as no
        theology can contain the Spirit; no faithful worship can be alien to
        God. The range of Friendly persuasions is usually associated with the
        following organizations:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.fgcquaker.org/">Friends General Conference</a>{" "}
        (FGC), to which Morningside belongs, includes about 500 meetings or
        worship groups and has a membership of about 35,000. Most of the
        Meetings are unprogrammed meetings without a pastor or set liturgies
        other than silence.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://fum.org/">Friends United Meeting</a> (FUM) claims about
        60,000 members in North America and approximately 140,000 worldwide,
        making it the largest of the three major groups. Meetings are often
        called churches, and they generally have a pastor and “programmed”
        worship.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.evangelicalfriends.org/">
          Evangelical Friends International
        </a>{" "}
        (EFI) consists of almost 300 North American Quaker churches with an
        estimated membership of 30,000. Worldwide, EFI membership numbers up to
        100,000. It expresses itself as a community of all who believe in Jesus
        Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.fwccworld.org/">
          Friends World Committee for Consultation
        </a>{" "}
        (FWCC) seeks to forge links among these differing expressions of
        Quakerism.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Morningside is a member of a wider network of Friends unprogrammed
          Meetings.
