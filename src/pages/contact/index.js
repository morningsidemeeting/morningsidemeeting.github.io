        For in-person worship, Morningside Friends meet in the tower of the
        Riverside Church in New York City, which is located on Riverside Drive
        and 120th Street near Columbia University, where Harlem and the Upper
        West Side meet. (120th Street is also named Reinhold Niebuhr Place.)
      </p>

      <p>
        We enter the church at the Claremont Avenue entrance at 91 Claremont
        Ave. From Riverside Drive, where the main entrance to the church is,
        walk one block east on 120 Street and turn left. The Claremont Avenue
        entrance is on the west side of the street.
