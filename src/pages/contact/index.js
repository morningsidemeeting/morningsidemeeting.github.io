        Morningside Friends meet in the tower of the Riverside Church in New
        York City, which is located on Riverside Drive and 120th Street near
        Columbia University, where Harlem and the Upper West Side meet. (120th
        Street is also named Reinhold Niebuhr Place.)

        walk one block east on 120 Street and turn left. The Claremont Avenue
