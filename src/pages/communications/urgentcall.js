      <h2>An Urgent Call to the Religious Society of Friends</h2>
      <p>May 2022</p>
      <p>
        We Quakers, members of the Religious Society of Friends, hold strongly
        to the principle of speaking truth with integrity. We ground our
        speaking truth in our worship and our searching of ourselves, as we
        listen deeply and honestly within and across all differences. Our
        testimony to the world includes standing up for spiritually discerned
        Truth, the equality of all persons, the peaceful resolution of
        conflicts, and respect and care for our neighbors and the earth. Right
        now, we see many forces at work in our country and the world that are
        undermining these basic values. Accordingly, we call on Friends
        everywhere to act.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this country, in 2020, we witnessed an attempted coup. The January 6
        assault on the Capitol was a deliberate, violent attempt to prevent Joe
        Biden — the clear winner of the 2020 election — from taking office and
        keeping then-president Donald Trump in power. To maintain that the last
        election was riddled with fraud is demonstrably false. This politically
        motivated movement has now embarked on an orchestrated campaign to
        suppress voting by black, brown and young people and to pass new state
        election laws giving the power to throw out huge numbers of valid
        ballots to highly partisan legislatures, governors, and state attorneys
        general. Thus, this lie is being used to deprive people of their
        constitutional rights and constitutes a major injustice.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Friends, we feel called to speak out against these falsehoods and
        anti-democratic actions. We encourage Friends to seek spiritual guidance
        on any actions that you and your meetings might take to witness against
        this gross injustice. If this politically motivated movement succeeds in
        its anti-democratic takeover attempt, any hope of making significant
        progress on racial and economic justice, the equality of all people, the
        climate crisis, gun violence, and other urgent issues of our time will
        be gone.
      </p>
      <p>
        We know that democracy in the United States has many flaws. During the
        past 100 years, our local, state and federal governments have acted to
        prevent formerly enslaved people and other communities of color from
        voting. It was not until 1920 that women finally won the right to vote,
        and their equality is still being challenged. We call on Friends to act
        — first, to resist all efforts to undermine our current democratic
        processes, and second, to support true democratic reforms to our still
        flawed election system. We cannot allow a government that is built on
        lies and injustice.
      </p>
      <p>
        We the undersigned are encouraging Quakers throughout the country to
        work in their local communities, states, and the national arena to take
        critical actions to prevent an authoritarian takeover of our democracy.
        We urge Friends to discern the deep truths that provide a foundation for
        active love, wisdom, compassion, and a truly democratic electoral
        system—and then to actively support such changes. We know that love
        conquers fear. Let us lean into Divine Love and find ways forward in
        Truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the reverse are two queries for you and your meeting to consider in
        response to this call. We’ve also included a list of specific actions
        that Friends could begin taking now. Some actions may become necessary
        later if there is another attempted coup during the next presidential
        election cycle.

      <h2>Queries</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          What, if anything, is the Light Within calling Friends to do in
          response to the unprecedented rise of domestic extremism, white
          supremacy, and authoritarianism that is threatening the destruction of
          our democracy at home and abroad?
        </li>
        <li>
          How can I/we respond with resolute love even while I/we may be
          struggling with fear, anger, apathy, or hate?

      <h3>Defending Truth</h3>
      <p>
        We urge all Friends to discern the deep truths that provide a foundation
        for active love, wisdom, compassion, and peace in the world — and then
        to defend them. We ask:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Individual Friends to search yourselves about the threats to our
          country, and the world, and to witness publicly to the truths that you
          discern are grounded in your experience of the Spirit.
        </li>
        <li>
          Quaker meetings and organizations to issue public statements calling
          out lies and the purveyors of lies, all in the context of our
          understanding of love, equality, and justice for all. Working for True
          Equality and Justice for All We urge Friends to act for equality and
          equity within our diverse society:
        </li>
        <li>
          Join or support organizations led by people of color which are working
          for the empowerment of black, brown, indigenous and Asian people and
          communities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Speak, write, and protest in support for full equality of all people
          in American society, whatever their racial or sexual identity, gender,
          or class.
        </li>
        <li>
          Support legislative and economic changes that would lead to actual
          equity among all peoples.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Promoting Free and Fair Elections</h3>
      <p>
        Stemming from our testimonies of Integrity and Equality, we urge Friends
        to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Support non-partisan voter-registration drives, particularly in
          communities under attack from those seeking to prevent them from
          voting.
        </li>
        <li>Publicly condemn partisan efforts to restrict access to voting.</li>
        <li>
          Confront partisan efforts to seize control of the election
          administration apparatus.
        </li>
        <li>
          Support conscientious, non-partisan election officials in our
          communities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Volunteer as poll workers, election monitors, and drivers to get
          people to the polls.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Preparing for Non-Violent Resistance</h3>
      <p>
        We believe that as a religious society grounded in nonviolence, we can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Initiate discussions on the impacts of voter suppression and new laws
          enabling partisan actors to legally throw out ballots and change the
          results of elections, then garnering support for nonviolent resistance
          against all this, and forming community-based networks of support for
          such actions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Arrange for nonviolent direct-action training in our Quaker meetings
          and organizations, as well as with others in our larger communities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Form small “affinity groups” that can prepare to carry out direct
          actions in support of free and fair elections and the state and local
          officials who support them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Support wider efforts to plan and organize nonviolent resistance on a
          state and nationwide level, as needed.
        </li>
      </ul>
