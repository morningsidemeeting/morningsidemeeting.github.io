Without potluck and those moments of face-to-face interaction, we question how we can share ourselves with others. If we cannot share physically, perhaps we can connect by sharing important stories in our lives. Some of the stories that we have incorporated in our spiritual growth involve narratives about times of welcome and times of rejection. Both stories have helped us form our spiritual identities. The first story, welcome, may be easier to share, although the second story, rejection, is equally essential to our development. Friends will be queried about both stories and the wisdom they may have given. As in all worship sharing, Friends are invited to share or not to share as they are led.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Morningside Meeting Ministry and Counsel is a committee charged with the pastoral care of\\nthe meeting.
