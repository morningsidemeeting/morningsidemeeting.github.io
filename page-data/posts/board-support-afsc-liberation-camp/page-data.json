For the past ten years, we have taught young people how to create change in their communities through art and activism. During last year\\u2019s camp, I was able to stay at Penington Friends House, which is right next door to where we host the summer camp. As someone who lives on Long Island, being in such close proximity to where the summer camp took place made being in community with campers and staff alike a smooth process. I was able to show up early and create a welcoming environment before campers arrived and stick around to invite questions and offer support to campers and our staff. Overall, staying at Penington allowed me to show up and support the camp to my fullest capacity. This year, I anticipate the needs of the camp only increasing and I know that residing at the Penington for its duration will ensure that we can all focus our energy on having another successful year as we hit this amazing milestone.
