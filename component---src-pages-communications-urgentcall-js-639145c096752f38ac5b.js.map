We ground our\n        speaking truth in our worship and our searching of ourselves, as we\n        listen deeply and honestly within and across all differences. Our\n        testimony to the world includes standing up for spiritually discerned\n        Truth, the equality of all persons, the peaceful resolution of\n        conflicts, and respect and care for our neighbors and the earth. Right\n        now, we see many forces at work in our country and the world that are\n        undermining these basic values. Accordingly, we call on Friends\n        everywhere to act.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In this country, in 2020, we witnessed an attempted coup. The January 6\n        assault on the Capitol was a deliberate, violent attempt to prevent Joe\n        Biden — the clear winner of the 2020 election — from taking office and\n        keeping then-president Donald Trump in power. To maintain that the last\n        election was riddled with fraud is demonstrably false. This politically\n        motivated movement has now embarked on an orchestrated campaign to\n        suppress voting by black, brown and young people and to pass new state\n        election laws giving the power to throw out huge numbers of valid\n        ballots to highly partisan legislatures, governors, and state attorneys\n        general. Thus, this lie is being used to deprive people of their\n        constitutional rights and constitutes a major injustice.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        As Friends, we feel called to speak out against these falsehoods and\n        anti-democratic actions. We encourage Friends to seek spiritual guidance\n        on any actions that you and your meetings might take to witness against\n        this gross injustice. If this politically motivated movement succeeds in\n        its anti-democratic takeover attempt, any hope of making significant\n        progress on racial and economic justice, the equality of all people, the\n        climate crisis, gun violence, and other urgent issues of our time will\n        be gone.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We know that democracy in the United States has many flaws. During the\n        past 100 years, our local, state and federal governments have acted to\n        prevent formerly enslaved people and other communities of color from\n        voting. It was not until 1920 that women finally won the right to vote,\n        and their equality is still being challenged. We call on Friends to act\n        — first, to resist all efforts to undermine our current democratic\n        processes, and second, to support true democratic reforms to our still\n        flawed election system. We cannot allow a government that is built on\n        lies and injustice.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We the undersigned are encouraging Quakers throughout the country to\n        work in their local communities, states, and the national arena to take\n        critical actions to prevent an authoritarian takeover of our democracy.\n        We urge Friends to discern the deep truths that provide a foundation for\n        active love, wisdom, compassion, and a truly democratic electoral\n        system—and then to actively support such changes. We know that love\n        conquers fear. Let us lean into Divine Love and find ways forward in\n        Truth.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        On the reverse are two queries for you and your meeting to consider in\n        response to this call. We’ve also included a list of specific actions\n        that Friends could begin taking now. Some actions may become necessary\n        later if there is another attempted coup during the next presidential\n        election cycle.\n      </p>\n    </section>\n    <section className={Styles.queries}>\n      <h2>Queries</h2>\n      <ol>\n        <li>\n          What, if anything, is the Light Within calling Friends to do in\n          response to the unprecedented rise of domestic extremism, white\n          supremacy, and authoritarianism that is threatening the destruction of\n          our democracy at home and abroad?\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          How can I/we respond with resolute love even while I/we may be\n          struggling with fear, anger, apathy, or hate?\n        </li>\n      </ol>\n    </section>\n    <section>\n      <h2>Possible Actions</h2>\n      <h3>Defending Truth</h3>\n      <p>\n        We urge all Friends to discern the deep truths that provide a foundation\n        for active love, wisdom, compassion, and peace in the world — and then\n        to defend them.
